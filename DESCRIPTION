Title: pipeComp pipeline benchmarking framework
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: as.person("Pierre-Luc Germain <germain@hifo.uzh.ch> [aut, cre]")
Description: A simple framework to facilitate the comparison of pipelines involving various steps and parameters. The `pipelineDefinition` class represents pipelines as, minimally, a set of functions consecutively executed on the output of the previous one, and optionally accompanied by evaluation and aggregation functions. Given such an object, a set of alternative parameters (which might include different subroutines) and benchmark datasets, the `runPipeline` function then proceeds through all combinations arguments, avoiding recomputing the same step twice and compiling evaluations on the fly to avoid storing potentially large intermediate data.
